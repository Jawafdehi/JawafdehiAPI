"""Tests for the pure NES entity resolver (casework/entity_resolver.py).

Every string here is real: the extracted names come from the July A/B run logs
(work/2026-07-17-enricher-extraction/), the NES ids and stored names come from
prod reads. A wrong bind attaches a named person to a corruption case they had
nothing to do with, so the false-positive tests are the point of this file.

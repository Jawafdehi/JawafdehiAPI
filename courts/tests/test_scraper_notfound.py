"""Not-found detection across all four court portals.

The register sweep asks a portal "does docket N exist?" thousands of times, so
mistaking a not-found page for a hit is the single most damaging failure mode
available: it does not error, it mass-creates empty cases and (via
``_replace_entities``) deletes real parties.

Every fixture here is a real response captured from the live portal — one found
and one not-found per tier — so the predicate is tested against what the courts
actually serve rather than a guess at it.
